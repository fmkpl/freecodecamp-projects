1) Finish the arithmetic_arranger function that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems, and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

2) A Binary Search Tree (BST) is an common data structure where data is sorted hierarchically.
In this project, you'll learn how to construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal. You'll also learn key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

3) Complete the Category class. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category. The class should have an instance variable called ledger that is a list.

4) Abstract classes enable you to define formal interfaces - objects acting as blueprints for classes.
In this project, you'll discover how to implement an interface in Python while building a simple equation solver program.

5) The Merge Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle.
In this project, you'll learn how to interact with data structures by sorting a list of random numbers using the Merge Sort Algorithm.

6) In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle, and inherit its methods and attributes.

7) Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.
For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

8) Encapsulation is a core OOP principle based on writing code that limits direct access to data.
In this project, you'll discover new concepts related to encapsulation, such as getters, setters, and name mangling, and you'll use them together with what you already learned to create a program that calculates a projectile trajectory.

9) Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.
In this project, you'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then you'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.

10) Classes and objects are important programming concepts. These Object-Oriented Programming tools help developers to achieve code modularity, abstraction, and readability. And they promote reusability.
In this Sudoku Solver project, you'll learn how to use classes and objects to build a Sudoku grid and to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

11) Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
    - a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
    - a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
    - (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.

12) Python special methods are called in response to specific operations and enable you to customize the behaviour of your objects in a detailed and effective way.
In this project, you are going to explore some of the most common special methods while learning about vectors by building a vector space.
